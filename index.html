        <p>1. The web is a bunch of computers talking to one another.</p>
        <p>2.the web is a collection of HTML (hyper texts markup language).</p>
        <p>3.Major components include; user, computer, internet , http server and browser.</p>

      <div class="outline">
        <h3 class="title-two">HTML definition</h3>
        <p>1. HT-in HMTL: Hypertext-what the user sees.</p>
        <p>2. M- in HTML:Markup- what the layout looks like i.e. tags.</p>
        <p>3.L-in HTML: Language- what the computers reads, i.e- images, video, etc.</p>

        <h3 class="title-two">More About-Inner Workings</h3>
        <p>Computers are "stupid," in that they need specific commands/codes that direct computers how to display data. Commands direct computers to follow an inline format, such as break, <b>bold</b>, <em>emphasis</em>, and attributes commands. HTML is one command or programming language and is what makes up the layout of webpages.</p>
        <p>HTML is comprised of individual statements and each statement contains elements. These elements consists of <a href="https://www.udacity.com">attributes</a>, images and videos. In HTML hitting the space button will not show variation in distance between text or attributs. Markups are coded in HTML as open and close statements and includees.Markups are coded in HTML as open and close statements and include  &lt;&gt; brackets, however, while many of the coding statements in HTML must include closing statements, there are exception i.e the br or break statement..</p>

    <div class="Lesson"><h2>Lesson Two</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="text-one">
      <div class="outline"><h3 class="title-two">HTML and CSS</h3>
        <p>1. HTML is the structure/p>
        <p>2. CSS is the style</p>
        <p>3. Javascript,not to be confused with Java, changes elements and add interactivity within simple HTML.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="outline"><h3 class="title-two">HTMLS Structure</h3>
        <p>The strutcute of HTML coding is similar to a tree, with one limb branching off to another. The parent of those limbs being those aspects which came before it. This tree like structure is also called <em>"document object mode"</em> or DOM.</p>
        <p>HTML, is box oriented. What is meant by this is that, HTML reads and sets up in box formats, regardless of the actual shape of an object. For example; if a circle is the original shape, HTML will read is as a box around the circle. A circle can be created using element tools to resize and shape.</p>
        <p>CSS can be used with HTML to efficiently add style to HTML elements. <b>It is important to note, that files for a specific project should be saved in the same folder </b>- include CSS, HTML and image files together- otherwise CSS will not appear to have made any style changes tot he afore mentioned.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="outline"><h3 class="title-two">CSS Information</h3>
        <p>1. CSS is the language used to give an HTML document style. CSS can manipulate font, margins, background color, and image positioning to name a few. </p>
        <p>2. CSS uses specific syntax and rules seperate from HTML.</p>
        <p>3. HTML styling can be manipulated within in HTML, however this can be cumbersome and is not efficient in most cases. CSS makes the case for efficiency of style manipulation.</p>

      <div class="outline">
        <h3 class="title-two">Sizing</h3>
       <p>1. Since HTLM is composed of boxes it is important to know how to size boxes in order to make for an appealing end user product. </p>
        <p>2. Boxes can be sized using either a pixel count or it can be sized in terms of percentages.</p>
        <p>3. When sizing boxes there are four box aspects that must be accounted for</p>
      </div>
      <div class="outline"><h3 class="title-two">Box Positioning</h3>
        <p>"Div" is a blocking element, meaning that it has specific height and widths implied within them or attributed in them by the programmer. </p>
        <p>Adding a rule in CSS like {display:flex} will allow seperate "div" boxes to appear on the side by side in HTML</p>
        <p> While adding images occurs in HTML, sizing and positioning of these elements is done in CSS.
      </div>
      <div class="outline"><h3 class="title-two">Additional Considerations</h3>
        <p>Older borwsers sometimes have difficulty in defining the terms of statements, making the end result garbbled. To circumvent this it is recommened to enter in -webkit, -moz, and -ms proceeding certain codes. </p>
        <p>When calculating box size, calculate left border, padding, content, right padding and right border</p>
        <p> Avoiding repetition is important because it allows for efficient use of time both in creating coding and in changing coding at a later date. One way to create efficient code is to group together elements that will have the same look and style. For example on this particular page, most of the style applied, used classes that applied to each segement, and each segment has similar characterisitcs; i.e. background color. To achieve this I wrote out general classes like outline, title-two (for secondary titles) etc, that applied to each segement. The end result is that I only needed to write out code once for all segements. Should any changes need to occur within the segements at a later date, identifying changes will be easy for both the original programmer and any new person wishing to change styling. </p>
